For this project, I was tasked with creating a mock-restaurant page that would utilise javascript to dynamically render the page depending on which page you wanted to see. Hence, the html itself is rather barebones, only containing a header and footer, as well as a div which was designated for content. On launch and whenever one clicks another button, it would render the correct page into the div to show the desired page. This was chiefly achieved with a lot of DOM. Since the Menu and Contact pages contained several different excerpts of identical purpose, I broke them out into generator functions, which created the element, assigned all the right classes, and assigned any text and image link to the element when called.
