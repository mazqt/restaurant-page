    <!-- <h1>Cheazy's Cheaze and Wine</h1>
    <h3>The best wine bar in all of Trelleborg</h3>
    <p>After years of begging for a piece of Cheddar, or sometimes even a sad chunk of Gouda, Cheazy got fed up with his owner and decided to give the restaurant business a try. Thus was born Cheaze and Wine, the finest wine bar in Southern Sweden .</p>

    <p>We offer:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Premises almost as pawdorable as the owner, located in the cellar of the old pub Tre Lyktor</li>
      <li>A selection of cheese's handpicked by our head chef and Cheazy himself</li>
      <li>Lovely wines bought directly from French, Italian, and Swiss vineyards by Cheazy's owner Jesper</li>
    </ul>
